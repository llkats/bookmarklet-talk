<!-- ## putting stuff in public for the first time is hard
Note:
* nervewracking
* want to release only something that's good
* when i was releasing that bookmarklet, i realized i hadn't really released anything to the public before on behalf of just myself. i realized that it's really difficult.
* want to release only something that's good so people thing you're really good at programming. and even though it was this silly little thing with a bunch of ridiculous variable names, i just wanted to be accepted and have people think that i'm good at what i do
* bookmarklets can be a little easier because they're so small, and people just need to drag them to a bookmark bar to install. there's also less to mess up, and if it doesn't work, you can just fix it with a new one. not too much pressure or expectations for perfection. -->
